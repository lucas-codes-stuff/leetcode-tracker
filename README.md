# ðŸ—“ Weekly LeetCode Tracker

This tracker captures my **weekly progress** on LeetCode, focusing on insights, improvements, and patterns rather than individual problems. Each week, Iâ€™ll summarize:

- **Problems Solved**: The approximate count or categories of problems tackled.
- **Key Insights**: Techniques learned, patterns discovered, or any major "aha" moments.
- **Challenges**: Difficulties faced, topics I still need to improve on.
- **Next Week's Goals**: What I plan to focus on moving forward.

Check out my [DSA Section](https://github.com/lucas-codes-stuff/learning?tab=readme-ov-file#data-structures--algorithms-dsa) in the main learning repository to see related articles, tutorials, and notes I might use to adjust my approach.

## Weeks Overview

| Week | Problems Solved (Approx) | Categories Covered     | Key Insights & Highlights               | Challenges & Roadblocks              | Next Week's Goals                    |
|------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|1 - 01/06/2025|3|Arrays|Lots of string manipulation and conversion. Did Roman to Int and Int to Roman this week|None ATM|More array practice, going to move to NeetCode to try it out|
|2 - 01/13/2025|5|Arrays and Hashing|Did a lot with Hashmaps and Dictionaries. Testing the waters with those|Still None|More practice with arrays and two pointer problems|
|3- 1/20/2025||||||

*(I will update this table as I go along, typically at the end of each week.)*

## Reflections & Patterns

- **Patterns Over Time**: Note recurring solution patterns or common techniques.
- **Personal Growth**: Reflect on increased confidence, speed, or comprehension.
- **Long-Term Trends**: Identify if certain problem types are becoming easier or still need more attention.

**This tracker is a living document, evolving as I refine my approach to solving LeetCode problems.**
